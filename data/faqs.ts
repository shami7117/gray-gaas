    question: "What is Gas-as-a-Service (GaaS)?",
    answer: "Gas-as-a-Service (GaaS) is a revolutionary approach to LPG distribution that allows customers to pay for gas usage as they consume it, rather than purchasing full cylinders upfront. With smart meters and digital payment systems, you only pay for what you use, making cooking gas more affordable and accessible."
